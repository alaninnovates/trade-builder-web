# Trade Builder Website

## What's this?
Trade Builder is a Discord Bot and Website that allows players of the Roblox game [Bee Swarm simulator](https://www.roblox.com/game-details-web-subsite/games/1537690962/Bee-Swarm-Simulator) to publicly advertise and trade their stickers and beequips. The Discord bot can be used as a way to generate beautiful images that can be posted in trading servers, and the website can be used to reach a larger audience. The website also incorporates advanced filtering features, sucha s filtering by items, that would be difficult to do through a trading server.
